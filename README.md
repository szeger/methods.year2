This repository holds the files used in Biostatistics 655-6, the second year masters statistics courses about the analysis of longitudinal and multi-level data
This is a collaboration of Elizabeth Colantuoni and Scott Zeger, with possible future effort by one or more graduate students
It will comprise a series of .Rmd files, one for each chapter of a LeanPub book we are developing
